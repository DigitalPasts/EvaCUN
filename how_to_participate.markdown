## Registration
If you would like to participate in this shared task, please fill out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/Z2L3crKgfspPv4j38). Once we receive your registration information, we will send the training data to your email address. Please check your email regularly.
If you do not receive a reply for two days, please re-send the form.

**No need to register for each task seperately, you can participate in both tasks as long as the group stays the same. Different groups require seperate registrations.**

## Submitting Results
Once the deadline for registration is due we will publish the link to send the results. The submissions should be formatted as follows:
#### File Naming
The name of the should end with "_lemmatization.csv" or "_textcompletion.csv" according to the task. If you participate in both tasks 
The results should be in a CSV file that is identical in structure to the train and the test files but has a 'prediction' column where you put the lemma or the predicted token.

#### Writing the Technical Report
Papers should **not be longer than 4 pages** of content (not including references). Each task gets its own technical report.
To allow blind reviewing, please do not include author names and affiliations within the paper and avoid obvious self-references.  

**Papers must be submitted according to the submission deadline.**
