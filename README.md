# Task
Cuneiform is one of the earliest writing systems in recorded human history (ca. 3,400 BCE-75 CE). Hundreds of thousands of such texts were found over the last two centuries in the Middle East. Most of these texts are found on a clay or stone medium, and are written in Sumerian and Akkadian, beside relatively smaller corpora (still in the tens of thousands) in Elamite, Eblaite, Hittite, Hurrian, Urartian, Hattian, and Luwian, as well as languages which use alphabetic Cuneiform like Ugaritic and Old Persian.
