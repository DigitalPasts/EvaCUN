Akkadian is a language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia and served as was lingua
franca of the region, used for trade, diplomacy, and literature, and it also provided the basis
for many subsequent languages in the Near East. The Machine Translation (MT) task of
Akkadian documents is crucial to advance the understanding of the events described in the
tablets as well as the scholarly field altogether. However, since Akkadian is a low-resource
language, the existing corpora of Akkadian texts consists of a relatively small amount of
data, and research on multilingual models offers only minor improvements on LM/MLM
tasks, let alone MT tasks can hardly be addressed. For that matter, we wish to utilize a
platform which can facilitate reading and interpretation of Akkadian texts by leveraging the
power of high-resource languages like English, and to some extent Hebrew (that is not
considered high resource, but has significantly bigger datasets compared to Akkadian and
keeps on growing).  
EvaCun 2023 consists of three machine translation tasks – Akkadian (in cuneiform) to
English, Akkadian (transcription) to English and Sumerian (transcription) to English, based
on the corpora of royal, administrative, and financial texts we provide. Shared data and
several scorers are provided to the participants. The organizers rely on the honesty of all
participants who might have some prior knowledge of part of the data that will be used for
evaluation. Unfairly use of such knowledge is not permitted in the shared task.
The campaign is designed with the aim of answering three main questions:
- How can we make machine translation techniques show the best performance on
Akkadian in both the cuneiform and the transcription modalities?
- How can we promote the development of resources and language technologies for
Akkadian and Sumerian?
- How can we foster collaboration among scholars working on Akkadian and Sumerian
and attract researchers from different disciplines?  

EvaCun 2023 is co-organized with ALT 2023: “Ancient Language Translation Workshop”,
Macau SAR, China on Sep 4, 2023. As a co-located event with [MT-SUMMIT2023](https://mtsummit2023.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/),
this workshop will provide an
opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine
translation for ancient languages.  

EvaCun 2023 is organized by the Archaeological
department in Ariel University and the TAD Center for AI and Data Science at Tel-Aviv
University, Israel.
