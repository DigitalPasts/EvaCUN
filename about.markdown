The cuneiform writing system is a logo-syllabic script, written mostly by impressing wedge-like shapes on clay tablets. Cuneiform was also written on other preserved media, such as stone monuments and metal objects.  

Sumerian is the first recorded written language, spoken from around the fourth millennium BCE (perhaps before) to the early second millennium BCE. However, it remained a scholarly language studied, copied and taught as part of the cuneiform writing tradition that died out around the first two centuries of the common era. Sumerian is an isolate language that cannot be ascribed to any of the known language families.  

Akkadian is the earliest attested Semitic language, belonging specifically to the East Semitic branch. It is attested in writing from c. 2,700 BCE until the end of cuneiform writing. It was a spoken language for most of this period, until it was gradually replaced by Aramaic in the first millennium BCE. During the second millennium BCE, Akkadian was the *lingua franca* of the ancient Near East, in use from Iran to Anatolia, from Syria to Egypt. As such, significant amounts of cuneiform tablets written in Akkadian and Sumerian were discovered outside of Mesopotamia during this time, within the context of cuneiform traditions of other languages.  

The **lemmatization and text restoration** task of Akkadian and Sumerian documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to advance computational text analysis, and create linguistic resources like treebanks and word embeddings. However, since cuneiform languages are low-resource languages, the existing corpora of texts consists of a relatively limited amount of data for each historical period of cuneiform, which is moreover divided into different geographical areas and text genres.[^1] Existing lemmatizers have relied mostly on first millennium BCE Assyrian and Babylonian archival and royal texts, and the fragmentary nature of many cuneiform tablets, as well as lexical homonymy in Akkadian and Sumerian, makes the creation of new computational linguistic resources challenging.  

**EvaCun 2025** consisted of the following tasks _TBD_ based on the corpora of _TBD_ first millennium BCE literary and scientific texts and early second millennium BCE texts we provide. Shared data and several scorers are provided to the participants. The organizers rely on the honesty of all participants who might have some prior knowledge of part of the data that will be used for evaluation. Unfairly use of such knowledge is not permitted in the shared task.  

The **shared task** is designed with the aim of answering three main questions:
- Can LLMs show the best performance in lemmitaztion and restoration tasks for Akkadian and Sumerian, both from cuneiform and the transliteration modalities?
- How can we use LLMs to promote the development of resources and language technologies for Cuneiform languages?
- How can we use LLMs to foster collaboration between cuneiform scholars and researchers from different disciplines?  

EvaCun 2025 is co-organized with [ALP 2025](https://www.ancientnlp.com/alp2025/), Albuquerque, New Mexico, US from April 29 to May 4, 2025. As a co-located event with [NAACL 2025](https://2025.naacl.org/), this workshop will provide an opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of ancient languages processing. EvaCun 2025 is organized by the [Digital Pasts lab](https://digitalpasts.github.io/) at Ariel University and the TAD Center for AI and Data Science at Tel-Aviv University, Israel.
